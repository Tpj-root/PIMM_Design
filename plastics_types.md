From Design to Production: A Deep Dive into Plastic Injection Molding Machine



Here's a list of common plastics used in the manufacturing of electronic support parts, along with their typical applications:

1. Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS)
Applications: Housings, casings, and structural components for electronics.
Properties: Good impact resistance, durability, and ease of machining.
2. Polycarbonate (PC)
Applications: Lenses, covers, and protective enclosures.
Properties: High impact resistance, transparency, and good thermal stability.
3. Polypropylene (PP)
Applications: Insulators, connectors, and packaging.
Properties: Lightweight, chemical resistance, and excellent electrical insulation.
4. Polyethylene (PE)
Applications: Cable insulation, containers, and protective covers.
Properties: Good chemical resistance, flexibility, and moisture barrier.
5. Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)
Applications: Cable sheathing, connectors, and protective components.
Properties: Good chemical resistance and mechanical strength.
6. Nylon (Polyamide)
Applications: Gears, bearings, and structural parts.
Properties: High strength, wear resistance, and good thermal stability.
7. Thermoplastic Elastomers (TPE)
Applications: Flexible parts, gaskets, and seals.
Properties: Rubber-like flexibility and resilience.
8. Polyoxymethylene (POM)
Applications: Gears, bushings, and precision parts.
Properties: High strength, stiffness, and low friction properties.
9. Polystyrene (PS)
Applications: Lightweight enclosures and packaging.
Properties: Good rigidity and transparency, but low impact resistance.
10. Fluoropolymers (e.g., PTFE)
Applications: Insulation for high-temperature applications and corrosive environments.
Properties: Excellent chemical resistance and low friction properties.
11. Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET)
Applications: Electrical connectors and components.
Properties: Good strength, thermal stability, and resistance to moisture.
12. Acrylic (PMMA)
Applications: Light covers, screens, and display panels.
Properties: High transparency, UV resistance, and good impact strength.
